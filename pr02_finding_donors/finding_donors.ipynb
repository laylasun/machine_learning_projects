    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. **Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than \\$50,000**. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  _Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with_.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: **The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.**\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, **normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners**. Note that once scaling is applied, **observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.**\n",

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",

    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

For instance, in normal cases, the register data should be entered by swiping or scanning; hence, lots of manually entered register data may indicate that the person who used the register could steal customers’ credit card information. Also, an employee could be considered either misusing return policy or benefitting from fake returns if the app found that the register data indicating multiple returns or exchanges taken place for a particular good.

Then, a logistic regression model is used to analyze the risk areas.  ([Lee 1477]( http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01431160412331331012))\n",

However, we have normalized the numeric predictors to mitigate such influence. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logistic regression:** the dependent variable is binary. Also, after encoding, there are 103 binary variables that are either numeric or binary. Moreover, a relatively large dataset is provided given 45222 records in a cleaned dataset and the size of the dataset helps to comply with the one of the assumptions of logistic regression – larger sample size. However, spatial autocorrelation is usually associated with census data and the presence of such relationship may violate the assumption stating that each observation should be independent from each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "     Although logistic regression is not a classifier, unlike the other two, it provides the optimal estimates of the probability of a person earning above 50k or not. It might underperform compared to other classification models but it can be used to validate and compare the results from the classifiers.\n",

    "    Additionally, it takes so long for SVM to produce results that I thought the jupyter notebook stopped working and my crispy thin laptop kept making big noise while burning up fast.

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Processing Time\n",
    "\n",
    "From the charts of model training time and predicting time, we can see that KNN (in teal color) is the most time-consuming method among all three models, especially when the size of training dataset increases to the full amount – 36,771. When trained on the full training dataset, random forest (RF) is the second slowest and logistic regression is the fastest. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**RF** yields the highest accuracy score, above 0.9, on training set in all three cases with different size of training set. However, the accuracy score of RF decreases slightly when using the full training set. RF is able to achieve an almost 1.0 accuracy score when training on the smaller training set (10%). Both **KNN** and **logistic regression** have accuracy scores above 0.8 and below 0.9 on training set. The fluctuation of accuracy scores given different dataset size is hardly discernible in both cases for KNN and logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to testing, **RF** does not have any considerably higher accuracy score than the other two models. All models manage to provide accuracy scores slightly above 0.8 (but well below 0.85) in all three cases given different training size. The chart of accuracy score on testing set also indicates that larger size of training set could improve the accuracy score on testing set since the accuracy scores of both **logistic regression** and **RF** go up a bit when the training set size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### F-Score\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous section, F-0.5 score emphasizes precision. Given considerably high accuracy score that **RF** has on training set, the F-0.5 score on training set of RF model is also remarkably higher – reaching 1 – than those of KNN and logistic regression. However, when the training size increases, the F-0.5 score of RF on training set decreases; nevertheless, the F-0.5 scores on training set of RF are all above 0.85 (probably 0.9). In comparison, **KNN** yields F-0.5 scores above 0.7 while **logistic regression** manages to provide F-0.5 scores that fluctuate around 0.7 on training set. Interestingly, both KNN and logistic regression have the lowest F-0.5 scores on training set with 10% training data and similar scores with 1% and 100% training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "On testing set, **logistic regression** has the best F-0.5 score, which is still below 0.8 but seems to be at around 0.7, with a 100% training set. **RF** has the second-best F-0.5 score (hardly reaching 0.7) when training on 10% and 100% training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suitability and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Although **logistic regression** has higher accuracy scores on both training and testing sets, the 103 features used in the model might violate the assumption – independence of predictors. However, logistic regression could be used as a referencing model. **KNN** takes too much computation time and needs to store all the data for prediction. Therefore, **RF** is the most suitable model and it does yield the second-best scores in most cases on testing set. \n"

    "**Answer: ** \n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly speaking, a random forest (RF) model is trained by building multiple decision tree models with subsets of the training sample given different sets of predictors. Then, the RF model makes prediction by either averaging the results or taking the majority of results from all the tree models. And there is a well-explained [introductory example](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/06/introduction-random-forest-simplified/) illustrated by Tavish Srivastava about how a RF model is trained and makes prediction."

    "### Implementation: Model Tuning\n",
    "Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.\n",

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The five most important features for prediction are ranked in a descending order (from the most to the least):\n",
    "1. **Capital gain**: this feature indicates that the person has sold an investment at a value higher than the purchasing price. However, the point of this feature is that the person has earned the regular income that is high enough to make investment. The ability to make investment, regardless gain or loss, can strongly imply a relatively high income level.  \n",
    "2. **Capital loss**: this feature is chosen for the same reason as the first one: capital loss indicates the person has made investment. Making investment might imply that the person earns a relatively high income which can first pay off everything (rent/mortgage and tax) and enables the person to use the leftover for investment.\n",
    "3. **Age**: in general, the older, the more experienced and hence the more likely the person has a higher earning power. Normally, the salary will rise gradually throughout a person’s career. The reason for ranking age after capital gain and capital loss is that salary will increase as a person get older and more experienced, but there is no guarantee that the salary will increase to or higher than $50,000 considering the type of occupation. \n",
    "4. **Occupation**: some occupations pay more than others. For example, we might expect that a sales person will earn more than a cleaner.\n",
    "5. **Education level**: the higher the education level, the more likely a person receives a high starting salary (although it depends on the type of occupation). Given a higher base, the salaries would keep being higher than those started with a lower base as people develop their careers.\n"

    "According to the feature importance of the gradient boosting model, marital-status _Married-civ-spouse has the largest feature weight, then followed by capital loss, age, education num and capital gain. I was focused on the factors in work, such as age, occupation and work status, when picking the relevant features; so, I am quite surprised to see that one particular marital status would take the first place as the most relevant feature for prediction. Other than the marital status, the other four features picked by the model are similar to the ones I picked. Interestingly, capital loss is the second most relevant feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualization confirms my thoughts: age, capital loss and capital gain are among the most relevant and same from my pick while education num is the numeric version of education level which is encoded into various dummy variables. Occupation is included since it is also encoded into all unique dummy variables and none of the individual occupation would be a strong indicator for an income of at least $50,000.  For marital-status_Married-civ-spouse, as mentioned before, is the major difference. “Civ” means civil union and thus this feature implies that people that are married and potentially live with their spouse can be strongly linked to a higher income. Maybe, in 1994, such a marital status means stability in the household and strong motivation to earn and feed the family. \n"

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
